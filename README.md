# 📄 Resume Classification System – NLP & Machine Learning Project

## Overview
The **Resume Classification System** is a comprehensive NLP & Machine Learning project designed to automatically classify resumes into relevant job categories. This system leverages advanced text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate candidate profiling.

The project emphasizes **practical ML workflow**, **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **interactive model deployment** using Gradio.

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal.
- **Text Representation**: TF-IDF vectorization to convert resumes into numeric features.
- **Word Embeddings**: Semantic feature learning using **Word2Vec** and **FastText**.
- **Model Development**: Linear **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for accurate resume classification.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluated with **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **Classification Report**.
- **Interactive UI**: Gradio interface for real-time resume predictions.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Import resumes dataset (`UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`).
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Clean text, remove stopwords, lemmatize tokens.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Generate TF-IDF features and embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText).
4. **Model Training** – Train Linear SVM classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate model on unseen test data using accuracy and classification metrics.
6. **Deployment** – Build Gradio interactive UI for resume prediction.
